# Trust Explorer

[Trust Explorer](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/trust-explorer-rsbio) is an hackaton project built at ETHGlobal Paris 2023. The main idea was trying to combine reviews made with Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), a super exciting way to attest anything on the blockchain, with a sybil-proof system of ZK-verified wallet credentials such as WorldCoin, also a partner of the hackaton.  
This was possible thanks to the sophisticated yet simple custom resolver logic that is included in the EAS smart contracts, which allows us to double checks the ZK-proof sent by WorldCoin after a successful login before emitting an attestation.
