# Trust Explorer

[Trust Explorer](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/trust-explorer-rsbio) is an hackaton project built at ETHGlobal Paris 2023. The main idea was trying to combine reviews made with Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), a super exciting way to attest anything on the blockchain, with a sybil-proof system of ZK-verified wallet credentials such as WorldCoin, also a partner of the hackaton.
